# Project Title

## Introduction

This project is a simple implementation of Schnorr's Zero-Knowledge Proof (ZKP) in Rust, designed to be cross-compiled and run on a Raspberry Pi. The application prompts the user to input two different secrets and demonstrates the ability to prove that it verifies one of the secrets while not revealing the other. Additionally, it logs the performance of the Raspberry Pi during the verification and proof processes.

## Features

- Schnorr's Zero-Knowledge Proof (ZKP) implementation
- Cross-compilation for Raspberry Pi
- User input for two different secrets
